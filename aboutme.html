          My name is Raneem Soufi. I am currently a senior at Georgia State
          University majoring in Computer Science. I have some experiene in app
          development (Android Studio, XCode), as well as Web Development. In
          the back end, I have experience with Python and C++. I like to be
          flexible when it comes to projects, and enjoy trying out new ideas,
          software, and technologies.

          This site was made for CS4720, Human-Computer Interactions, taken
          Spring 2022. From this class I hope to expand my knowledge of how we
          as people can use technology to our advantage outside of just a
          computer or mobile device.
